In this Module I have used inbuilt methods such as:

- addEventListener()
- fill()
- setInterval()
- setTimeout()
- some()
- every()
- forEach()
- includes()
- contains()
- add()
- remove()
- createElement()
- appendChild()
- push()
- Array()
- async functions

### Rules to play the Game

- Easy - A grid of 100 blocks with 20 mines.
- Medium - A grid of 225 block with 45 mines.
- Hard - A grid of 400 block with 80 mines.
- Right Click to mark a Square as a Flag ðŸš©, click again to unmark the Square
- Any number on the board refers to the number of mines currently touching that number's square.
- To win a round of Minesweeper, you must flag all the squares that has a mine under it. Once you've done so, the game will be over.
